# Development
The project was developed in Unity3D version 2019.4.21f1. Various problems may occur with version changes. 

The project was split into two phases due to time concerns. In the first phase, the requirements to be delivered as a graduation project were determined and acted accordingly. The common point of the agreed requirements for the first phase was that it was on the infrastructure of the game. Thus, the second phase could be passed without wasting time. However, the project was stopped by a joint decision before the second phase was started. Therefore, the project was not completed.
