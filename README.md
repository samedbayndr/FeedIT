# Development
The project was developed in Unity3D version 2019.4.21f1. Various problems may occur with version changes. Observer, Singleton and State design patterns were used in the project.

The project was split into two phases due to time concerns. In the first phase, the requirements to be delivered as a graduation project were determined and acted accordingly. The common point of the agreed requirements for the first phase was that it was on the infrastructure of the game. Thus, the second phase could be passed without wasting time. However, the project was stopped by a joint decision before the second phase was started. Therefore, the project was not completed.

# Gameplay

The main purpose of the game is to meet the needs of your farm far from the city and grow your farm. You should take your animals to pasture areas to feed your herd. If the animals do not listen to your shepherd's calls, you can take a dog into your herd. If you lose all of your herd animals due to labour pain or starvation, you must restart the game. You can use workers for work on your farm and grazing your animals. You can buy coops and get eggs from chickens. For a balanced coop, eight chickens should be purchased for each purchased rooster.

KEYS:

W,A,S,D = Camera movements

C = Forces the animals to follow the shepherd for a certain period of time when take the animals out to graze

V = Shepherd call animals when take the animals out to graze
